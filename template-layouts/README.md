# Flexible Layouts

This folder contains layouts which are called by `acf-flexible-content.php` when the editor is using ACF flexible content fields to create their page layout.

The filenames must match the slug of the row in the flexible content field.

Typically, these template partials may also include items from the `template-components` folder.

Partials are used to keep the codebase DRY and to ensure the code is more easily maintained.
